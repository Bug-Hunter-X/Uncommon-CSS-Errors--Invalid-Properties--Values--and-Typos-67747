The CSS code contains an invalid or unsupported property or value, resulting in unexpected behavior or rendering issues.  For instance, using a property that's not part of the CSS specification or using a value that's not valid for a particular property can cause rendering problems across browsers. Another potential issue is a typo in the property or value name, which can also lead to unexpected behavior.
